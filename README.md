# Webshop

Webshop is a mock-up e-commerce website with most basic features, which include: 
* Browsing products by category, sorted by date/name, with different page sizes
* Viewing the details of a product: a product may have various variants and each one can be sold by some number of merchants. 
* Placing orders by putting some variants into the basket. You need to be logged in. You will also need to create an address to which your order will be dispatched.
